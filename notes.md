## Notes From The Readings

- Already before reading this I am intrigued. I took a two data vizualization classes this year and really enjoyed the concepts, theories and work behind the lessons and projects in both classes.I have expirience working with and creating many vizualizations over the course of the year, but never to repsent historical timelines or information like I imagine will be covered in this weeks work. 

- "Begin constructing and overlaying physical networks (of artists, publishers, customers, advertisers, material suppliers involved in the trade) with representative networks (of places, people, locations found in designs produced by the trade) using ArcGIS (or similar)."
    - I have made node-link diagrams and such, but this is really new to me!
 -"Extract all the listings for businesses associated with printed images (data: 1794, 1808), assign longitude and latitude coordinates to their addresses, and map them (using TileMill rather than ArcGiS; see https://cradledincaricature.com/2012/09/28/week-4-heatmaps/ for more detail)."
    - This is me making a mental note to look into that link later 
- **‘soft’ digital/’digital’/Digital [hH]istory.** : documenting the history you personally care about rather than everything? --> *Will have to come back to this definition later.*
- Space was a very inportant concept when crafting this work
- "Stationers" overpowered the first representation that was made, so it was then filtered out in the second version which lead to the discoveries of more patterns amoung the other 3 categories
    - Do not be afraid to play with the data yu have available (abstract, filter, hide, exclude, etc) as it ight reveal more information of what is important to you or trends thaat were not as easily seen before.
- Spatial patterns are very important... look where points are clustered or how far they are spread out
- "I don’t make an argument within them, rather my thinking – and subsequent source analysis – flowed from constructing them." 
    - This point was pretty impactful, y=I personally don' often see this kind of idea in thereadings I usually do. Doing the work but not making a point with the result, but rather the process.
